#### A toolbox for Statistical Machine Learning

* Features
 - Association Rule
 - Decision Tree, where CART algorithms is used
 - k-means
 - Naive Bayes
 - linear SVM (some code borrows from libsvm)
   + [TODO] summary the SMO and the related optimization

* Some practice
  - Sentiment analysis in the Mobile phone industry (~/practice/)


* CNN (TODO)
