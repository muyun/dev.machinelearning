#### Notes on Machine Learning & AI

#### Supervised learning - predict a certain outcome from a given input, and we have examples of input/output pairs. 

##### Classification - predict a class label from a predefined list of possibilities
##### regression - predict a continuous number or a floating-point number 
 - Models ->  trade-off of model complexity against training and test accuracy
